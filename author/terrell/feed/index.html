										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Henrico Too Smart 2 Start Coalition is leading the county in observing #NoMentholSeason, an awareness campaign about the dangers of flavored tobacco products, especially since flavors are attractive to youth.&nbsp; No Menthol Season is an extension of No Menthol Sunday, which was May 15, 2022.&nbsp; The coalition is reigniting the initiative in an effort to ensure the FDA follows through on their pledge to ban menthol cigarettes, which is the last non-tobacco characterizing flavor legally available in cigarettes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to doctors at MD Anderson Cancer Center, a leading cancer center in the United States, “Cigarette smoking has been on the decline for years. But menthol cigarettes are one segment of the tobacco market that has remained strong. Menthol is a flavor additive with a minty taste and smell. In addition to tasting good, it has a cooling and painkilling effect. Cigarette manufacturers add it to cigarette filters to cover up the unpleasant taste of tobacco and make cigarettes more appealing.”1 Menthol in cigarettes also enhances the addictive effects of nicotine and makes it more difficult to quit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tobacco industry has aggressively marketed menthol products to young people and African Americans. Tobacco use is a major contributor to heart disease, cancer, and stroke; three major causes of death among African Americans.&nbsp; The failure to ban menthol from tobacco exacerbates additional health disparities and continues to attract youth before they can legally decide to smoke.&nbsp; Throughout the season, HTS2S will be using its social media accounts, community movies, and partnerships with area churches to promote this initiative. To support No Menthol Season, HTS2S is asking the residents of Henrico to perform one if not all of the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Watch, “Black Lives/Black Lungs”, a very short (15 minutes) award winning video investigating the tobacco industry’s successful infiltration into the Black community: <a style="font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeg5BNx--uQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeg5BNx&#8211;uQ</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Inform a teenager that vapes that they can text DITCHVAPE to 88709 to access an <a href="https://truthinitiative.org/thisisquitting">innovative free text-based program</a>, and/or help a colleague or loved one quit tobacco by referring them to <a href="http://quitnow.net/Virginia">http://quitnow.net/Virginia</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Become familiar with Menthol facts at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/mentholfacts">https://tinyurl.com/mentholfacts</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Like a No Menthol Sunday video of HTS2S’s Youth Task Force at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=henrico+too+smart+2+start">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=henrico+too+smart+2+start</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Sign HTS2S’s petition as a Henrico resident in favor of banning Menthol flavor in tobacco, <a href="https://tinyurl.com/HTS2S-HVAresidents2FDA">https://tinyurl.com/HTS2S-HVAresidents2FDA</a>, and/or sign a national petition at <a href="https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/get-involved/fda-flavor-petition-2022">https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/get-involved/fda-flavor-petition-2022</a>.&nbsp;</li>
